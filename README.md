# threats
This contains the replication files for 'A New Measure of Foreign Threats'. In this project I develop a predictive model of militarized disputes in the international system from 1870 to 2001. In so doing I ensemble a variety of candidate models from machine learning which offers a 49% improvement in out of sample prediction over that of a null model. With this model in hand I then use its out of sample predictions to develop a new state-level measure of foreign threat - how likely it is that a state will experience the onset of a militarized dispute in a given year.
